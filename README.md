# Studify Workspace

This repository now organizes code by platform boundary. The existing React/Vite application lives in `frontend/`, leaving room to add a backend or other services alongside it.

## Frontend

- Location: `frontend/`
- Tech stack: Vite + React + TypeScript
- Commands:
  - `cd frontend && npm install`
  - `cd frontend && npm run dev`
  - `cd frontend && npm run build`

Add backend services (for example, `backend/`) beside `frontend/` when you're ready.
